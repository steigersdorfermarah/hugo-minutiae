<h1>The project</h1>
Minutiae is an open source, MIT Licenced software for a fingerprint system and a cooperation project
with the OTELO Gmunden. While Minutiae provides the frontend, the backend and the database, the co-projects
takes over the hardware and the hardware related code.
The project idea is a system in which users and administrators exist.
Users can use fingerprint sensors and unlock / lock doors according to their authorizations.
There is a web interface for administrators through which they can make various system settings.
This eg. includes adding new users and doors.

<h3 id=hardware>Hardware</h3>
<h4 id=requirements>Requirements</h4>
<p><li>One Raspberry Pi (= Microcontroller) + custom shield per door</li>
<li>One fingerprint sensor per door</li>
<li>A working local network (=> router/switch/..), but not necessarily an internet connection for the running system</li>
<p>Each microcontroller is managing one single door and also has its own backend,
frontend and database running on it. The advantage of this decentralized system is,
that even if one door is seperated from the other doors for some reason,
it will still work on its own (even though changes are not effective for it anymore, of course),
and also there is no central server if dying would make the whole system inoperable.</p></p>
